# candidate-wordcloud
Generate wordclouds from the websites of political candidates.

## Instructions

1. Click [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbonsma/candidate-wordcloud/HEAD) to launch the interactive notebook. Once it loads, double-click on the file called `candidate_wordcloud.ipynb` in the left pane. This will open an interactive notebook in your browser 
2. Get the URL for a candidate you are interested in. Ideally, find a page that has policy or platform information on it (this is usually called something like "priorities" or "platform").  
3. Paste the URL inside the quotes in the first box, and type a name to save your finished wordcloud under.
4. In the top-left menu "Run", choose "Run all cells". Alternatively, click the double-arrow button (>>) in the top bar above the notebook. This runs the code and hopefully generates a nice wordcloud for your candidate! 
5. The finished wordcloud will be saved in the interactive folder; to download it, find the filename in the left pane, right-click, and choose 'Download'.
